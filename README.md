Modules for a low cost robot head @ Vienna University of Technology
This modules are part of my master thesis which aim to provide the following functionalities:
 * Face detection
 * Face recognition
 * Object classification
 * Speech recogintion

The packages use the Robot Operating System (ROS.org) and run either on a standard computer running GNU/Linux, other operating systems may work too, and Android based systems.
